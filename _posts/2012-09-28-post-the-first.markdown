Hello. This is my post. I've been wanting a place to write about code and code-related
stuff. I decided Github is the natural place to do it, especially since I wanted to use
Jekyll for the site.

I threw together a quick site based on [Bootstrap][] and [Jekyll][], and here I am. It
looks pretty Spartan, and it's not going to get much more ornamental. Hopefully it will
get more functional, but it will probably always look like a default Bootstrap site. I'm
not a designer. I know you understand.

[Jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/
